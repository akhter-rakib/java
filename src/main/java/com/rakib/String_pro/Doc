String Immutable :
When we talk about the String object is immutable actually we are talking about the String object in memory.
Once a String is created in String pool then Never can change this value . Because it can be used by another reference.

Benefit of String Immutability :
Thread Safety: Immutable strings can be safely shared across multiple threads without the risk of data corruption, as their state cannot be modified after creation.

Security: Immutability ensures that sensitive information stored in strings cannot be altered maliciously, providing a level of security, especially in scenarios like authentication or cryptography.

Efficiency: Immutable strings allow for optimization in memory management and string operations, as certain optimizations can be applied knowing that the content of a string will not change.
